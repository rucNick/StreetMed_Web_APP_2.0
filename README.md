## Overview

This repository contains the StreetMedGo application, including both the backend and frontend code, along with UI/UX design patterns.

## Web App Overview
**WEB URL: https://app.streetmedatpitt.org/** 

StreetMedGo is a comprehensive platform designed to support the operations of StreetMed@Pitt, a non-profit organization providing medical outreach to underserved communities. The web application serves three primary user roles:

- **Clients**: Can request medical supplies and services, track their orders, and receive updates on deliveries.
- **Volunteers**: Can sign up for outreach rounds, view assigned orders, manage their availability, and coordinate with team members.
- **Administrators**: Can oversee inventory, manage volunteer applications, schedule rounds, assign team leads and clinicians, and generate reports.

The platform integrates several key systems:

- Round scheduling and volunteer coordination
- Order creation and fulfillment tracking
- Inventory management with automatic stock reservation
- Volunteer application and approval workflow
